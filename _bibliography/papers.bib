abstract = {Here, a non-enzymatic graphene stabilized nickel sulphide is used for electrochemical based device for detecting urea is carried out. NiS was used as electron distribution on the compound helps in selective interaction with analytes. However, since neat NiS is unstable during the interaction, stabilization of the compound is very critical. Hence, nickel sulfide/graphene oxide (NiS/GO) was synthesized via the superficial hydrothermal method. The synthesized functionalized GO nanoparticles were characterized for size, surface area, and morphology for tuning to the specific application. This compound nickel sulfide/graphene oxide was used to modify glassy carbon electrode (NiS/GO/MGCE). Detection capabilities of this modified electrode to urea in water was evaluated in both electrochemical and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) modes. Results suggests that the NiS/GO nanocomposite modified electrode exhibited a very low limit of detection and the electrode process was identified to be diffusion-controlled. In addition, selectivity, interference, long-term stability and practical applicability of the developed sensor were evaluated. Hence, the developed NiS/GO/MGCE displayed excellent electrocatalytic behaviour towards the sensing of urea with good sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility.}
