I'm Utkarsh Pratiush, a research professional with a passion for machine learning and its applications in science. I hold a Masters in Material Science from the Indian Institute of Science, where I used First Principles to study the electronic properties of Lanthana. I have since gained valuable industry experience as a Research Engineer at Mindtree Limited, where I developed skills in computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.

Currently, as a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Science, I'm applying machine learning to ecological and natural language processing research. I have also been a research intern at the Japan Advanced Institute of Technology, where I worked on drug discovery.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/UtkarshsAIInScience.github.io/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
