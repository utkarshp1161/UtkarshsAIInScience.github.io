At UT Knoxville, in my role as a Graduate Research Assistant, I'm harnessing the power of machine learning to fast-track materials discovery. My primary aim is to create automated workflows for microscopes. This endeavor is guided byDr. [Sergei](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=-cuxoSQAAAAJ&hl=en) in collaboration with [ORNL](https://www.ornl.gov/).

I earned my Master's degree in Material Science from the Indian Institute of Science. During this period, I delved into First Principles to investigate the electronic properties of Lanthana. Post my academic journey, I enriched my professional expertise as a Research Engineer at Mindtree Limited. Here, I honed my skills in computer vision, natural language processing, and forecasting time series data.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/UtkarshsAIInScience.github.io/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
