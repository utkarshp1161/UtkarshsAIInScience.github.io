A research professional with a passion for machine learning and its applications in science. Currently, as a Graduate Research Assistant at the UT Knoxville, I'm applying machine learning to accelarate materials discovery with the focus to build automated workflows in microscopes advised by Dr. [Sergei](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=-cuxoSQAAAAJ&hl=en) in collaboration with [ORNL](https://www.ornl.gov/)


I hold a Masters in Material Science from the Indian Institute of Science, where I used First Principles to study the electronic properties of Lanthana. I have since gained valuable industry experience as a Research Engineer at Mindtree Limited, where I developed skills in computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. 

Will be happy to get in touch and discuss Machine learning for materials.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/UtkarshsAIInScience.github.io/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
