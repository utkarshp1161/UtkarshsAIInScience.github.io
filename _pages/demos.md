## 1. Demonstration: EDX-EELS-Diffraction on particles
How much more can we learn by combining electron microscopy and computer vision algorithms - if we let ML agent to make decisions where to take EDX and EELS spectra?

In collaboration with Austin Houston and Gerd Duscher, demo video shows the deployment of the foundational SAM model to analyze Thermo Fisher Scientific Spectra 300 data stream, and perform the EDX and EELS measurements on the a priori selected locations on the Au/TiO2 nanoparticles.
